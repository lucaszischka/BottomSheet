/**
 The default BottomSheetPosition; it has the following cases and values: `top = 0.975`,  `middle = 0.4`,  `bottom = 0.125`,  `hidden = 0`.
 
 This BottomSheetPosition uses relative values. For absolute values in pixels, see BottomSheetPositionAbsolute.
 
 You can create your own custom BottomSheetPosition enum:
 - The enum must be conforming to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`
 - The case and enum name doesnt matter
 - The case/state with `rawValue == 0` is hiding the BottomSheet
 - The value can be anythig between `0` and `1` (`x <= 1`, `x >= 0`) or anything above `0` (`x >= 0`) when using the`.absolutePositionValue` option
 - The value is the height of the BottomSheet propotional to the screen height (`1 == 100% == full screen`) or the height of the BottomSheet in pixel (`1 == 1px`) when using the`.absolutePositionValue` option
 - The lowest value (greater than 0) automaticly gets the `.bottom` behavior. To prevent this please use the option `.noBottomPosition`
