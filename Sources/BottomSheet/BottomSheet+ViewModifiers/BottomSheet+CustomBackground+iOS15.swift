public extension BottomSheet {
    
    /// Sets the view's background to the default background style.
    ///
    /// This modifier behaves like ``View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:)``,
    /// except that it always uses the ``ShapeStyle/background`` shape style.
    /// For example, you can add a background to a ``Label``:
    ///
    ///     ZStack {
    ///         Color.teal
    ///         Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
    ///             .padding()
    ///             .background()
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Without the background modifier, the teal color behind the label shows
    /// through the label. With the modifier, the label's text and icon appear
    /// backed by a region filled with a color that's appropriate for light
    /// or dark appearance:
    ///
    /// ![A screenshot of a flag icon and the word flag inside a rectangle; the
    /// rectangle is filled with the background color and layered on top of a
    /// larger rectangle that's filled with the color teal.](View-background-7)
    ///
    /// If you want to specify a ``View`` or a stack of views as the background,
    /// use ``View/background(alignment:content:)`` instead.
    /// To specify a ``Shape`` or ``InsettableShape``, use
    /// ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-89n7j`` or
    /// ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-20tq5``, respectively.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - edges: The set of edges for which to ignore safe area insets
    ///     when adding the background. The default value is ``Edge/Set/all``.
    ///     Specify an empty set to respect safe area insets on all edges.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A view with the ``ShapeStyle/background`` shape style
    ///   drawn behind it.

    /// default background style.

    /// This modifier behaves like ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-89n7j``,
    /// except that it always uses the ``ShapeStyle/background`` shape style
    /// to fill the specified shape. For example, you can create a ``Path``
    /// that outlines a trapezoid:
    ///
    ///     let trapezoid = Path { path in
    ///         path.move(to: .zero)
    ///         path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 90, y: 0))
    ///         path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 80, y: 50))
    ///         path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 10, y: 50))
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Then you can use that shape as a background for a ``Label``:
    ///
    ///     ZStack {
    ///         Color.teal
    ///         Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
    ///             .padding()
    ///             .background(in: trapezoid)
    ///     }

    /// Without the background modifier, the fill color shows
    /// through the label. With the modifier, the label's text and icon appear
