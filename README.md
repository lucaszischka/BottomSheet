A sliding Sheet from the bottom of the Screen with 3 States build with SwiftUI.

## Why

There have been many different attempts to recreate the BottomSheet from Apple Maps, Shortcuts and Apple Music, because Apple unfortunately does not provide it in their SDK.

However, all previous attempts share a common problem: The **height does not change** in the different states. Thus, the BottomSheet is always the same size (e.g. 800px) and thus remains 800px, even if you only see e.g. 400px - the rest is **inaccessible** unless you pull the BottomSheet up to the very top.

There are also many implementations out there that **only have 2 states** - **not 3** like e.g. Apple Maps.

### Features
- Dynamic height (works with `ScrollView` and **every** other view)
- Fully customizable States (**any number of states at any height**)
- Many options for **customization** (backgroundBlur, tapToDismiss, swipeToDismiss, etc.)
- Very **easy to use**
- Support for **SearchBar** in the header
- Flick through feature
- Same behavior as Apple for the `.bottom` position
- Beatuiful customizable **animations**

## Requirements 

- iOS 13
- Swift 5.3
- Xcode 12

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The preferred way of installing BottomSheet is via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

>Xcode 11 integrates with libSwiftPM to provide support for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms.

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** → **Swift Packages** → **Add Package Dependency...**
2. Paste the repository URL (`https://github.com/LucasMucGH/BottomSheet`) and click **Next**.
3. For **Rules**, select **Branch** (with branch set to `main`).
4. Click **Finish**.

### CocoaPods

BottomSheet is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'BottomSheetSwiftUI'
```

## Usage

**WARNING:**
This is Sample Code for visualisation where and how to use, without a working initializer. Please see [Examples](#examples) for working code.

BottomSheet is similar to the built-in Sheet:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State var bottomSheetPosition: BottomSheetPosition = .middle //1
    
    var body: some View {
    
        Map() //2
            .bottomSheet() //3
    }
}
```

`//1` The current State of the BottomSheet.
- This is any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `BottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` (with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`//2` The view which the BottomSheet overlays.

`//3` This is how you add the BottomSheet - easy right?

## Parameters

### Title as Header Content

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    bottomSheetPosition: Binding<BottomSheetPosition>,
    options: [BottomSheet.Options] = [],
    title: String? = nil,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> mContent
)
```

`bottomSheetPosition`: A binding that saves the current state of the BottomSheet.
- This can be any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `BottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` for example (should be used with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`options`: An array that contains the settings / options for the BottomSheet. For more information about the possible options see [Options](#options).

`title`: A string that is used as the title for the BottomSheet.
- Can be `nil`.
- You can use a view that is used as header content for the BottomSheet instead.

`content`: A view that is used as main content for the BottomSheet.

### Custom Header Content

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    bottomSheetPosition: Binding<BottomSheetPosition>,
    options: [BottomSheet.Options] = [],
    @ViewBuilder headerContent: () -> hContent?,
    @ViewBuilder mainContent: () -> mContent
)
```

`bottomSheetPosition`: A binding that saves the current state of the BottomSheet.
- This can be any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `BottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` for example (should be used with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`options`: An array that contains the settings / options for the BottomSheet. For more information about the possible options see [Options](#options).

`headerContent`: A view that is used as header content for the BottomSheet.
- Can be `nil`.
- You can use a string that is used as the title for the BottomSheet instead.
- Any view is possible - this can lead to problems if the view is too large. A label, a small picture or text is recommended

`mainContent`: A view that is used as main content for the BottomSheet.

### Options

`.absolutePositionValue` Allows absolute values in pixels to be used as BottomSheetPosition values.

`.allowContentDrag` Allows the BottomSheet to move when dragging the mainContent.

- Do not use if the mainContent is packed into a ScrollView.

`.animation(Animation)` Sets the animation for opening and closing the BottomSheet.

`.appleScrollBehavior` The mainView is packed into a ScrollView, which can only scrolled at the .top position.

`.background(AnyView)` Changes the background of the BottomSheet.
- Must be erased to AnyView.

`.backgroundBlur(UIBlurEffect.Style = .systemThinMaterial)` Enables and sets the blur effect of the background when pulling up the BottomSheet.

`.cornerRadius(Double)` Changes the corener radius of the BottomSheet.

`.dragIndicatorColor(Color)` Changes the color of the drag indicator.

 `.noBottomPosition` Prevents the lowest value (above 0) from being the bottom position and hiding the mainContent.
 
 `.noDragIndicator` Hides the drag indicator.
 
 `.notResizeable` Hides the drag indicator and prevents the BottomSheet from being dragged.
 
 `.shadow(color: Color = Color(.sRGBLinear, white: 0, opacity: 0.33), radius: CGFloat = 10, x: CGFloat = 0, y: CGFloat = 0)` Adds a shadow to the background of the BottomSheet.
 
 `.showCloseButton(action: () -> Void = {})` Shows a close button and declares an action to be performed when tapped.
 
 - If you tap on it, the BottomSheet and the keyboard always get dismissed.
 
 - If you want to do something extra, you have to declare it here.
 
 `.swipeToDismiss` Dismisses the BottomSheet when swiped down.
 
 `.tapToDissmiss` Dismisses the BottomSheet when the background is tapped.

## Custom States

You can create your own custom BottomSheetPosition enum:
   - The enum must be conforming to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`
   - The case and enum name doesnt matter
   - The case/state with `rawValue == 0` is hiding the BottomSheet
   - The value can be anythig between `0` and `1` (`x <= 1`, `x >= 0`) or anything above `0` (`x >= 0`) when using the`.absolutePositionValue` option
   - The value is the height of the BottomSheet propotional to the screen height (`1 == 100% == full screen`) or the height of the BottomSheet in pixel (`1 == 1px`) when using the`.absolutePositionValue` option
   - The lowest value (greater than 0) automaticly gets the `.bottom` behavior. To prevent this please use the option `.noBottomPosition`

This BottomSheetPosition is provided and uses relative values:
```swift
public enum BottomSheetPosition: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case top = 0.975, middle = 0.4, bottom = 0.125, hidden = 0
}
```

This BottomSheetPositionAbsolute is provided and uses absolute values and requires the the`.absolutePositionValue` option:
```swift
public enum BottomSheetPositionAbsolute: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case top = 750, middle = 300, bottom = 100, hidden = 0
}
```

This CustomBottomSheetPosition is an example for a custom BottomSheetPosition with relative values:
```swift
public enum CustomBottomSheetPosition: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case middle = 0.5, hidden = 0
}
```

## Examples

**PLEASE NOTE:** When installed via Cocoapods, please keep in mind that the pod is called `BottomSheetSwiftUI` and not `BottomSheet`; so please use `import BottomSheetSwiftUI` instead.

### Book Detail View

This BottomSheet shows additional information about a book.
You can close it by swiping it away, by tapping on the background or the close button.
The drag indicator is hidden.
It uses a custom `enum` for the states with absolute values, since only the states `.middle`, `.bottom` and `.hidden` should exist with a predefined absolute height.

### Word Search View

This BottomSheet shows nouns which can be filtered by searching.
It adopts the scrolling behavior of apple, so that you can only scroll the `ScrollView` in the `.top` position.
The higher the BottomSheet is dragged, the more blurry the background becomes (with the BlurEffect .dark) to move the focus to the BottomSheet.

### Artist Songs View

This BottomSheet shows the most popular songs by an artist.
It has a custom animation and color for the drag indicator and the background, as well as it deactivates the bottom position behavior and uses an custom corner radius and shadow.
